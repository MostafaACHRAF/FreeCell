#################################################### Description ############################################
FreeCell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable.[1] Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).

A version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.
